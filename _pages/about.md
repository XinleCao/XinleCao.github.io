<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Zhejiang University. I am working on encrypted databases especially those applying Order-preserving Encryption (OPE) and Oblivious RAM (ORAM). I am concerned about the security, efficiency, and functionality of encrypted databases. My research interest includes a wide range of directions, e.g., MPC, DP, and HE. I am open to all forms of collaboration. Please feel free to reach me if I can help you.
